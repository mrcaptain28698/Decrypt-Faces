# Decrypt-Faces

#### The generative AI model operates in two stages: first, it utilizes Nvidia's style transfer model to create a latent vector representing the style of a face from a textual description. In the second stage, another model converts these latent vectors into realistic photographic faces. 
# Technologies used: Python, Tensorflow, Generative Adversarial Network Model, Streamlit.
#### Dataset Used for model training: Celeba Faces(https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html)
